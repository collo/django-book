Stuff to cover later
====================

This is a running list of stuff that hasn't yet been mentioned in the
completed chapters of the book:

Using other template systems with Django
========================================
    
The serialization framework and the bundled simplejson.
=======================================================

As I write this, I think it might be a good idea if we have time to cave to
pressure and write a chapter on doing "AJAX" with Django.

Invalidating Django cache
=========================
Simon: [Chapter 14] is missing any discussion of the importance of
invalidating your cache manually to keep the site completely up to date - for
example, having code which clears the cache for the front page every time a
new blog entry is saved (rather than making you wait 5 minutes before it gets
displayed).

Jeremy: Perhaps this sort of thing is best handled with signals?

Book conventions
===========
[foo_name] is a placeholder for a user-given value.
decorator syntax 2.3 or 2.4?

Why aren't 3rd party libs bundled?
==================================
python-memcached isn't bundled, probly due to licensing complications. (It's
python licensed, while Django is BSD.) A policy statement would be good.

Other authentication sources
============================

The last part of authentication.txt ("other authentication sources") needs to
be somewhere in the bok, but the auth chapter feels pretty long already... I'm
not sure where the "right" place for this material is.
